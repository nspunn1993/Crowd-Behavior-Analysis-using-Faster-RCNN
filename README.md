# Crowd-Behavior-Analysis-using-Faster-RCNN
Crowd Analysis for Congestion Control Early Warning System on Foot Over Bridge.
This follows from the tensorflow object detection API available [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/r1.12.0)

# Steps to follow
- Set up the object detection directory structure (already done in this repo) and TensorflowGPU enable anaconda virtual envrironment.
- Generate the labelled dataset.
- Divide the labelled datset into trainig and test set.
- Generate label map and configure the training parameters.
- Train the object detector model and export the inference graph for testing.
